Lecture 5 - HTML content models
* block-level elements (create a new line) vs inline elements (no new line)
   - div
* inline elements can contain other inline; block elements can contain other block or inline.
   - span

HTML 5 has 7 categories, not just those 2 - https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html#kinds-of-content
  * block-level is somewhat similar to "flow content" context
  * inline is somewhat similar to "phrasing content"

Lecture 6 - Heading elements and some new HTML5 semantic elements
* sematic html element implies meaning to the context
* _may_ help SEO
* H1/H2 heading tags are semantic, use them to mark headings in your content, NOT as style
* Always use H1 and it should contain the central meaning of the content (crucial to SEO)
* other sematic tags - header, nav, section, article, aside, footer (ALL ARE BLOCK LEVEL ELEMENTS - visually you could of course just use div's and styles, but then you lose the sematic meaning when looking at the html itself)

Lecture 7 - Lists
* alredy knew all this (ul, ol, li)

Lecture 8 - HTML Character Entity References
* Escaping characters, e.g. < > & (&lt; &gt; &amp;)
* copyright - &copy;
* control wrapping - &nbsp (non-breaking space) - apply margins in span tags to create spacing between words; using &nbsp for that is a misuse of that tag!
* use entity references like &quot; to get around rendering issues with encoding

Lecture 9 - Creating Links
* always use a "title" tag in your a href tag for screen readers
* the "a" tag is both block and inline (flow and phrasing) so can surround a div tag, img tag, etc
* fragment identifiers (critical in single-page-apps SPA's), e.g. the # stuff via <section id='foo'> or <a name='foo'>
* external vs internal (relative) links

Lecture 10 - Images
* img:  src, width, height, alt tags
   - use width and height so browser doens't "jump around" if it's loading and so broken images take up the right amount of space
